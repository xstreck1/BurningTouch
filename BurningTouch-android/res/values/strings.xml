    <string name="description">
        Heat the paper with a touch to reveal its hidden story.\n 
        \u00A0 Be careful though - too long a touch will scorch the paper and the message within.\n
        \u00A0 Only after you uncover the whole message you will be allowed to continue with the story.\n
        \u00A0 Light and vibration will tell you how hot your touch is. 
        Beware though, even a bit of heat on already burned area may start the flame.  \n
        \n 
        Sounds:\n
        \u00A0 Night of Chaos, Kevin MacLeod\n
        \u00A0 Burning-Room, suonho\n
        \u00A0 Bell Rise 4, DJ Chronos\n
        \n
        \u00A0 Note: Volume is controlled by your device. If the sound is on but you do not hear anything (in game, there is no menu music), try increasing the volume by appropriate button.
